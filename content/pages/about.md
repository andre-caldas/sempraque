An amazing friend of mine is egging me on to study *point-free topology*.
Some call it *"pointless"* topology.
Of course, that's a ready-made joke, and I couldn’t help but follow suit.
So, the blog is called *"sem pra quê"* — literally, “without a what for”.
Or, more naturally, *"without a purpose"*.

My name is André Caldas.
I am a math professor at the
[University of Brasília](https://mat.unb.br/).
In this blog,
I'll share some thoughts as I learn *point-free topology*.
What for?... I don't really know! :-)
