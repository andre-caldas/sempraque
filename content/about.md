An amazing friend is egging me on to study *point-free topology*.
Some call it *"pointless" topology*.
Of course, it is a ready-made joke and I couldn't help doing like everyone else.
Therefore, the blog is called *"sem pra quê"*.
In a literal translation,
"without a *what for*" (without a purpose).

My name is André Caldas.
I am a math professor at
[University of Brasília](https://mat.unb.br/).
In this blog,
I shall write some thoughts while I learn *point-free topology*.
What for?... I don't really know! :-)
