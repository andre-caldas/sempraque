  Given the complete lattice corresponding to a topology...
  without using points or sets...
  how can we distinguish filters that may or may not correspond to the open neighbourhoods of a point?

This is the continuation of
[part 1](basic-idea-part-01).

That's the Question
-------------------

So, we are looking at the open sets of a topology.
But we are using those blinders...
we do not see sets!

Pick up a
[filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(mathematics))
in the lattice.
Is it possible that this filter correspond to the family $\tau(x)$ of open neighbourhoods of a point $x$?
What criteria could we use to distinguish filters that might or not be open
